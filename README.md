#Espaco

This project was made using Eclipse Oxygen, Java 8 and Tomcat 9 I used MySql database. The creaton script is on the root folder. The username and password to access the database is admin, admin.

eSpatial Tech Challenge

This is a project for the eSpatial.

Requirements:
 - Write an open system, without specific requirements, using Spring Framework and showing some map.
 
What was evaluated:
 - Knoledge of Sprint framework: SpringBoot, SpringJPA, SpringMVC
 - Knoledge of Database Connection
 - Knoledge to work with maps.

I've used:
 - Eclipse Oxygen
 - Tomcat 9
 - Java 8
 - MySql database
 - Bootstrap to build Framework
 - JQuery and Json as data source for some screens

This project was based on an existing website made by me for a Brazilian client (that's why it's almost all in Portuguese). The original system wasn't using Java, since my client had access only to a free server without JVM. I've used JSON files as datasource being accessed by JQuery GET to be able dynamic data and being possible for the Client update data only changing JSON files.
The map points used at Contact page are being loaded from Database.

I've changed the first Service box "Psicoterapia" to load from database using Ajax and REST webservice.

To use the system, just checkout and deploy. A MySQL database must be created with username admin and password admin. The schema and tables script creaton is on the root folder.

Thanks!
Adriano.
